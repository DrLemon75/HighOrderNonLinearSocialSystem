# Higher-order nonlinear social system with feedback loops and social norms
# Building a higher-order nonlinear social system with feedback loops and social norms can be a complex and involved task, and the specific implementation details would depend on the specific system being modeled. However, here's a general example of how you could start building such a system in Python:

import numpy as np

# Define the system parameters
num_agents = 100
num_iterations = 100
alpha = 0.5
beta = 0.5
gamma = 0.1
delta = 0.1

# Define the initial agent states
agent_states = np.random.normal(size=(num_agents, 2))

# Define the agent interactions and social norms
def agent_interaction(state_i, state_j):
    return alpha * (state_j - state_i) + beta * (state_j - state_i) ** 3

def social_norm(state_i, state_j):
    return gamma * np.exp(-delta * np.linalg.norm(state_j - state_i, ord=2))

# Run the simulation
for t in range(num_iterations):
    for i in range(num_agents):
        # Compute the agent's new state
        new_state = agent_states[i]
        for j in range(num_agents):
            if i != j:
                interaction = agent_interaction(agent_states[i], agent_states[j])
                norm = social_norm(agent_states[i], agent_states[j])
                new_state += interaction * norm
        agent_states[i] = new_state

# Plot the final state of the agents
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(agent_states[:, 0], agent_states[:, 1])
plt.show()

# This code defines a social system with num_agents agents, and runs a simulation for num_iterations time steps. The agents are initially assigned random states, and their states are updated according to an interaction rule and a social norm. The interaction rule takes into account the difference between the agent's state and the states of other agents, and the social norm determines how much weight to assign to each interaction.

# In this example, the interaction rule is a simple linear combination of the difference between the states of two agents, and the social norm is a decaying exponential function of the Euclidean distance between two agents. These values could be adjusted or replaced with other functions, depending on the specific social system being modeled.

# Note that this is just an example, and you would need to modify the code to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you may want to add more complex logic for analyzing the system behavior or generating reports based on the simulation results.
